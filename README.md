## Pomodoro Clock - [freeCodeCamp Project](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-pomodoro-clock/)

I used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to make the set up easier.
And I used these references when I got stuck while building the app:
- https://codesandbox.io/s/7zyz2y4p5j for tick and startCountDown

This is a **work in progress** so in the coming weeks you'll see:

- [X] A [link](https://marvokdolor.github.io/pomodoro-clock-fcc/) to this app deployed to GitHub-pages ([reference](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/surge-vs-github-pages-deploying-a-create-react-app-project-c0ecbf317089))
- [ ] An app that passes all the tests in the test suite (hamburger icon in upper left corner)
- [ ] Better design using Bootstrap

If you're curious about my freeCodeCamp work please check out my [portfolio](https://codepen.io/marvokdolor/full/bmLbQy/) currently on CodePen, but moving to GitHub-pages in the coming months.
